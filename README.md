vanilla JS - Conways Game of Life - practice 

Practicing different code projects with javascript. Came across a neat interpretation of this classic coding exercise and decided to recreate it to practice some skills. Nothing fancy. Thanks to Lance Concannon for his fiddle about this and explaining the process.

Next I'm going to do this in Ruby :-)
